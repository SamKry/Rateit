Rateit is a powerful app designed to help you rate and organize your favorite items. Whether you want to rate your favorite books, movies, or products, Rateit has you covered. This app is perfect for those who want to keep track of their preferences and share their opinions with others.

## Key Features

### Rate Anything
With Rateit, you can easily rate any item you love. Each item, known as a Rit (short for Rate-It), can be customized with various attributes to capture your thoughts effectively.

### Organize Your Collection
Rateit allows you to organize your Rits into folders and tag them for easy categorization. This helps you keep your collection well-structured and accessible.

### Detailed Information
Each Rit can contain the following attributes:

- **Folder**: Assign Rits to folders for better organization.
- **Tag**: Tag your Rits with keywords to simplify searches.
- **Title**: Give your Rit a catchy title.
- **Description**: Add detailed information about the item.
- **Link**: Attach links related to the item.
- **Pictures**: Include images to visually represent the item.
- **Notes**: Add additional notes or comments.

### Quick Creation
Creating a Rit is a breeze with Rateit. You can quickly add a new Rit through a shortcut or by long-pressing the app icon. Additionally, when sharing an image, you have the option to create a Rit directly.

### Barcode/QR Code Scanning
Rateit supports barcode and QR code scanning for effortless Rit creation or searching. Simply scan the code, and Rateit will gather relevant information.

## Collaboration (Open for Discussion)

Rateit is constantly evolving, and we're open to discussions regarding new features. Here are some potential areas of expansion:

- **Share a Rit**: Explore the possibility of sharing Rits with others via files or links.
- **Share Folders**: Allow users to share entire folders of Rits with friends or colleagues.
- **Create Shared Folders**: Enable collaborative collections where multiple users can contribute to a shared folder.

## Stay Connected

Rateit is built with the future in mind. While it currently relies on a local database, we plan to implement iCloud sync and other exciting features in upcoming releases. Stay tuned for updates!
